# Prefab Handles

## Description
Package to make handles using prefabs. These handles use the unity rendering and lifecycle and are not bound to immediate mode like the default handles. This is made to make it easier to author more complex handles and as a first step towards making handles compatible with DOTS. This package is available at runtime.
